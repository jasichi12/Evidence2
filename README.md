# Evidence 2: Integrative Blog
During the course of these 5 weeks I was able to learn more about digital tools and I covered topics about linear programming and forecasting, I learned how they are applied in real life situations and problems as well as how I can apply them in my life daily, what most caught my attention during the sessions were the various graphs represented during the classes and the development of the most advanced programming language than I was used to, one of the challenges I faced during these classes was that the classes were in English for which made it difficult for me to understand some concepts and also the overload of work made me not concentrate much, however, outside of class I knew how to review and practice topics seen in class, thanks to the tolerance and understanding of the teacher it was very easy to carry out all my activities and develop in class.
